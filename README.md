# Realistic Terrain Generation
Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) is a Minecraft mod that adds a new world type which generates realistic terrain. It doesn't add new blocks. It doesn't add new mobs. It doesn't even add new biomes. It simply generates existing biomes (including those added by other mods) with more realistic-looking terrain.  

# Project roadmap
* Get all vanilla biomes generating 'realistically' alongside custom biomes
* Remove custom biomes completely. This mod will eventually only generate realistic terrain for vanilla biomes and biomes that have been added by other mods.
* Add inherent support for all popular biome-adding mods (Biomes O' Plenty, ExtraBiomesXL, Highlands, Enhanced Biomes, Thaumcraft, etc.) and generic support for any mod that adds new biomes.
* Create an API to allow other mods to customise terrain generation

# Developers
RTG is built on Forge 1.7.10-10.13.4.1448 and compiled with Gradle 2.0.

# Downloads
Downloads can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/whichonespink44/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/releases) section, but please note that RTG is currently in alpha, which means that it should only be used for testing purposes. Do not attempt to load any of your existing worlds with this mod installed or you run the risk of corrupting them.

# Credits
This mod is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](https://github.com/Ted80-Minecraft-Mods/Realistic-World-Gen) mod by [Ted80](https://github.com/Ted80-Minecraft-Mods). It was created as a new project because it will likely deviate from Ted80's original vision for RWG, and the author of this mod didn't want to interfere with that vision.
