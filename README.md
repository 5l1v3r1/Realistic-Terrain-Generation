# Realistic Terrain Generation
Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) is a Minecraft mod that adds a new world type which generates realistic terrain.

# Credits
This mod is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](https://github.com/Ted80-Minecraft-Mods/Realistic-World-Gen) mod by [Ted80](https://github.com/Ted80-Minecraft-Mods).

# Project roadmap
* Get all vanilla biomes generating 'realistically' alongside custom biomes
* Remove custom biomes completely. This mod will eventually only generate realistic terrain for vanilla biomes and biomes that have been added by other mods.
* Add inherent support for all popular biome-adding mods (Biomes O' Plenty, ExtraBiomesXL, Highlands, Enhanced Biomes, Thaumcraft, etc.) and generic support for any mod that adds new biomes.
* Create an API to allow other mods to customise terrain generation
