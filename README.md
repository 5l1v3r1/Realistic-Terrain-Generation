Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) is a mod that adds a new world type which generates realistic terrain. It doesn't add new blocks. It doesn't add new mobs. It doesn't even add new biomes. It simply generates more realistic-looking terrain for existing Overworld biomes (including those added by other mods).

This mod is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](http://goo.gl/1qWQte) mod by ted80. It was created as a new project because it was expected to deviate from ted80's original vision for RWG, and the author of this mod didn't want to interfere with that vision.

RTG is brought to you by [Team RTG](https://goo.gl/mT0ehq) and contains a number of [contributions](https://goo.gl/QMXecT) from various members of the Minecraft modding community. It also uses KdotJPG's [OpenSimplex Noise](https://goo.gl/7MNhlE) to generate its terrain.

All downloads can also be found in the [Releases section](https://goo.gl/mR3ucQ) on GitHub.

**Important! As of v0.5.0, you will also need to install either [Climate Control](http://goo.gl/6c9Htb) or [BiomeTweaker](http://goo.gl/hy502C) if you wish to control the way vanilla biomes generate (e.g. enable/disable, change biome weight, change biome size, etc.), or if you want to use any of the following biome-adding mods:**

* Biomes O' Plenty
* ExtraBiomesXL
* Highlands
* BuildCraft
* Ars Magica 2
* Alternate Terrain Generation (ATG)
* ChromatiCraft

_(Note: Enhanced Biomes and Thaumcraft do NOT require Climate Control or BiomeTweaker.)_

**Did you know?** Whilst not required, it is strongly recommended that you also install [FastCraft](http://goo.gl/65haJy) for increased performance.

(Please note that RTG is currently in beta, which means that it should primarily be used for testing purposes. If you plan to use RTG in a 'live' environment, be sure to generate a new world, and be aware that newer versions may not be backwards-compatible.)

### REVOLUTION|2

[![](http://i.imgur.com/9qzDKot.png)](https://goo.gl/JY4YqP)

[REVOLUTION|2](https://goo.gl/JY4YqP) is a difficult, quest-based RotaryCraft/ChromatiCraft-themed progression pack by Haggle1996. Built around the three pillars of design, tech, and magic, version 2 surpasses its predecessor with extended game play, many new mods, and a new quest system.

### Survival Stories 3

[![](http://i.imgur.com/3WIMs2f.png)](http://goo.gl/koMHLS)

[Survival Stories 3](http://goo.gl/koMHLS) combines exploration with the modded experience we all know and love, including some mods developed specifically for the pack. Whether you like magic mods, tech mods or just want to explore the Minecraft world, expect this to be your favorite mod pack of 2016.

![](http://i.imgur.com/y6EgTdG.png)

* Download and install the **RECOMMENDED** version of [Forge for 1.7.10](http://goo.gl/KHgnMZ) (the one on the right).
* [Download this mod](http://goo.gl/WP0WmR) and place it in your 'mods' folder.
* If you want to use any of RTG's supported biome-adding mods, you must also install either [Climate Control](http://goo.gl/6c9Htb) or [BiomeTweaker](http://goo.gl/hy502C).
* For singleplayer... create a new world, click the [More World Options] button, choose 'Realistic' from the [World Type] button, then click [Create New World]
* For servers... use **level-type=RTG** in server.properties

**Did you know?** RTG is only required server-side, so if you're hosting a modded server or putting together a mod pack, your users don't even need to have RTG installed!

#### RTG configuration

When you launch Minecraft after installing RTG for the first time, a folder called [RTG](https://goo.gl/UQrlLy) gets created in your config folder. The RTG folder contains the main configuration file ([rtg.cfg](https://goo.gl/SUfDbO)) and another folder called [biomes](https://goo.gl/E50m2A) which contains separate config files for each of the biome-adding mods that RTG supports (as well as a config file for vanilla biomes).

Inside RTG's config files, you'll find options for tweaking various aspects of your Minecraft world: biomes, caves, dungeons, mineshafts, strongholds, villages, and more. Each option contains a brief description about what the setting does, but if you're still not sure about a particular setting, feel free to post your questions in the thread.

#### Climate Control configuration

When you launch Minecraft after installing Climate Control (CC) for the first time, the main configuration file (climatecontrol.cfg) gets created in your config folder, along with a folder called 'ClimateControl' which contains some additional config files. If you installed a supported biome-adding mod, there will also be a config file in the 'ClimateControl' folder that is specific to that mod.

CC's default settings should be fine for most users. However, if you're not sure about a particular option, feel free to post your questions in the thread.

#### BiomeTweaker configuration

When you launch Minecraft after installing BiomeTweaker for the first time, a folder called 'BiomeTweaker' gets created in your config folder. Inside that folder you will find the main configuration file (BiomeTweaker.cfg), an example config file (ExampleTweaks.cfg), and a folder called 'output' which contains a .json file for each registered biome.

If you're comfortable using mods like MineTweaker and ModTweaker, then you'll have no problem with BiomeTweaker. However, if you're new to the art of 'tweaking', then we would recommend that you use Climate Control instead, as it's much easier to configure.

To make it easier for everyone to get up and running with RTG & BiomeTweaker, we've created a set of working tweaks that you can use to get started. To use the tweaks below, just download the 'BiomeTweaker.cfg' and 'RTG.cfg' files for your relevant mod setup and move them to your BiomeTweaker folder. (Note: If you're using more than one biome-adding mod, you will need to create your own tweaks.)

* RTG (Optional): [BiomeTweaker.cfg](https://goo.gl/oDu4RQ) | [RTG.cfg](https://goo.gl/lhG6ew)
* RTG + Biomes O' Plenty: [BiomeTweaker.cfg](https://goo.gl/oDu4RQ) | [RTG.cfg](https://goo.gl/pJm5E3)
* RTG + Enhanced Biomes (Optional): [BiomeTweaker.cfg](https://goo.gl/oDu4RQ) | [RTG.cfg](https://goo.gl/fKHdF6)

* RTG + EBXL: [BiomeTweaker.cfg](https://goo.gl/oDu4RQ) | [RTG.cfg](https://goo.gl/R9eSQi)

* RTG + Ars Magica 2: [BiomeTweaker.cfg](https://goo.gl/oDu4RQ) | [RTG.cfg](https://goo.gl/EzsKsJ)
* RTG + ATG: [BiomeTweaker.cfg](https://goo.gl/oDu4RQ) | [RTG.cfg](https://goo.gl/8Ja48t)

![](http://i.imgur.com/JbkjIyC.png)

**When will RTG be updated for 1.8?**
There are no plans to update to 1.8 at this time.

**May I use RTG in my public/private mod pack?**
Please see 'Mod pack policy' section below.

**Does RTG add any new blocks/items to the game?**
No.

**Does RTG add any new biomes?**
No. RTG only affects vanilla biomes and biomes that have been added by other mods.

**Does RTG add any dimensions?**
No.

**Does RTG add any mobs?**
No.

**Does RTG generate realistic terrain in non-Overworld biomes (e.g. The Nether, The End, etc.)?**
No. RTG only affects the Overworld.

**How should I report issues/bugs/crashes?**
You may report issues in this thread, but please use spoiler tags or [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for crash reports, and please describe what you were doing immediately before the crash. The more information you provide, the easier it will be to resolve the issue.

**How do I prevent a biome from generating?**
RTG does not provide a way for you to disable biomes. To prevent a biome from generating, you must disable it via the config files of the mod that adds it. In the case of vanilla biomes, you must use either [Climate Control](http://goo.gl/6c9Htb) or [BiomeTweaker](http://goo.gl/hy502C).

* You understand and accept that RTG is in beta, which means that it is currently under heavy development and could change radically from version to version, with no guarantee of backwards-compatibility.
* You understand and accept that only the latest version of RTG will be supported at any given time.
* You must credit 'Team RTG' as the author of this mod and link back to this forum thread.
